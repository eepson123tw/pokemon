This is a pratice which will try to play with react and use some fancy plugin to build with.

## point
  1. use react 18.2
  2. use react hook
  3. use custom hook and composition way (such as Compound Component,useContext and useProvider combo)
  4. use the tailwind css
  5. use the fp soild way to think the design pattern
